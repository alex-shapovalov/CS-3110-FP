## Overview

Our project uses data from **SyntheticHealth**, an organization that creates mock patient data for ML use. 

Data available here: https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/

## Methods

We explored several privacy-preserving techniques, including:

- Applying **Laplace** and **Gaussian noise**
- **k-Anonymizing** data
- **Clipping** sensitive values
- Testing:
  - **Propose-Test-Release Framework**
  - **Sample and Aggregate Framework**
